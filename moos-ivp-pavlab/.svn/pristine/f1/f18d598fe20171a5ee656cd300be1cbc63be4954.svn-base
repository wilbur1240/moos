This task behavior will compute a dubins turn for the shortest path. 
Given the smallest turn radius which an agent can take, we calculate the odometry

To use the dynamic loading of behaviors, you need to set the following 
environment variable (in your .cshrc file for tcsh users, or the equivalent
for bash users):

setenv IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIRS '/home/bob/moos-ivp-swarm/lib'
